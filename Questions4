The Museum Caper
Professor Amelia Parsons, a renowned archaeologist, stood bewildered in the ransacked Egyptian exhibit at the Grand City Museum. Her prized artifact, the golden scarab of Pharaoh Atemhotep, was missing! Determined to find it, she enlisted the help of her brilliant niece, Maya, known for her knack for puzzles.

As they sifted through the broken display case, Maya spotted a cryptic note tucked beneath a shattered shard. It appeared to be a shopping list from a local antique store, but something felt off.

"This must be the thief's clue, Aunt Amelia," Maya declared. "Can you help me decipher it?"
